# NeRFDeltaView Ensemble

We developed a visualization tool for visualizing the uncertainty estimated by the [NeRF Uncertainty Ensemble](https://github.com/CTW121/NeRF-Uncertainty-Ensemble).

Uncertainty visualization provides users with an in-depth understanding of the data for analysis and to perform confident and informed decision-making. The main purpose of our tool is to highlight the significance of interactive visualization in enabling users to explore the estimated uncertainty in synthesized scenes, identify model limitations, and aid in understanding NeRF model uncertainty.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have a **Linux/Windows/Mac** machine.
- You have installed **Python 3.8 or higher**.
- You have installed [**PyTorch**](https://pytorch.org/).
- You have installed [**PyQt6**](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/).
- You have installed [**VTK from Python wrappers**](https://docs.vtk.org/en/latest/getting_started/index.html).

We recommend running the application using [**conda**](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

## Run the Visualization Tool Application

To run the NeRFDeltaView Ensemble visualization tool application, follow these steps:

1. Copy the trained model from [NeRF Uncertainty Ensemble](https://github.com/CTW121/NeRF-Uncertainty-Ensemble) (checkpoint and yml files) to [VTK_writer](https://github.com/CTW121/NeRFDeltaView-Ensemble/tree/master/VTK_writer) folder.

2. <!-- VTK_writer -->

3. <!-- Preprocess 2DTF heatmap -->

4. <!-- TO BE WRITTEN -->

<!-- WRITE THE EXECUTION CODE -->

<!-- Put the FIGURE 3D Volumetric data? -->
