# NeRFDeltaView Ensemble

Our developed a visualization tool for uncertainty visualization in the [NeRF Uncertainty Ensemble](https://github.com/CTW121/NeRF-Uncertainty-Ensemble).

Uncertainty visualization provides users with an in-depth understanding of the data for analysis and to perform confident and informed decision-making. The main purpose of our tool is to highlight the significance of interactive visualization in enabling users to explore the estimated uncertainty in synthesized scenes, identify model limitations, and aid in understanding NeRF model uncertainty.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have a **Linux/Windows/Mac** machine.
- You have installed **Python 3.8 or higher**.
- You have installed **PyTorch**.
- You have installed **PyQt6**.

We recommend running the application using **conda**.
